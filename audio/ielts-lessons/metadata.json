I feel excited because I enjoy learning about different perspectives and potentially forming new friendships, which makes life more interesting. However, I also feel a bit nervous initially because I'm not sure how the interaction will go or if we'll connect well. Once the conversation starts flowing though, I usually feel more comfortable and the nervousness fades into genuine interest.",
