## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: "Stuck" at Loading**
**Check Console for:**

- Is download percentage increasing?

**If YES:** It's working! Just be patient (model is 587MB)
**If NO:** Check internet connection, try refreshing page

---

### **Problem: Errors During Generation**
**Console will show:**
```
❌ ERROR generating audio for m2_intro:
Error type: TypeError
Error message: Cannot read property 'audio' of undefined
Full error: [detailed stack trace]
```

**Common causes:**
- TTS model not fully loaded
- Out of memory (too many browser tabs)
- Browser storage quota exceeded

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh page and try again
2. Close other tabs
3. Clear browser cache (but you'll need to redownload model)

---

### **Problem: Audio Files Show as "Pending"**
**This means they haven't been generated yet**

**To fix:**
1. Click "🔍 Check Status" to refresh
2. Run "Generate All Audio" again
3. Console will show which files were skipped vs generated

---

## 📝 **Console Commands (Advanced)**

### **Check which audio files exist:**
```javascript
const stats = await window.audioManager.getCacheStats();
console.log('Cached audio files:', stats.files.map(f => f.id));
```

### **Clear all cached audio:**
```javascript
await window.audioManager.clearCache();
console.log('All audio deleted');
```

### **Check TTS status:**
```javascript
console.log('TTS loaded?', window.ttsService.isLoaded);
console.log('TTS loading?', window.ttsService.isLoading);
```
