I really enjoy listening to jazz music, particulaly in the evening when I want to unwind after a long day. I usually play it at home or during my commute because the smooth melodies help me feel relaxed and focused . what I love most about jazz is how it can be both soothing and intellectualy stimulating at the same time.
