# IELTS Writing Task 2 - Content Review Report

## Executive Summary

I reviewed all 70 IELTS Writing Task 2 topic JSON files for language naturalness, accuracy, and student usefulness. This report details findings and recommendations for improvements.

## Key Findings

### 1. **CRITICAL ISSUES - FIXED**

#### Grammar Error (FIXED ✓)
- **File**: `celebrity-role-models.json`
- **Issue**: Pronoun agreement error - "Malala Yousafzai has used **their** fame" should be "her fame"
- **Status**: ✓ FIXED

#### Vocabulary Example Mismatches (FIXED ✓)
- **File**: `remote-work.json`
- **Issue**: Word "facilitate" not used in its own example sentence
- **Status**: ✓ FIXED - Changed to "Open office layouts facilitate communication and collaboration among team members."

### 2. **LANGUAGE NATURALNESS ISSUES**

#### Formulaic/Repetitive Patterns
Many vocabulary examples follow overly formulaic patterns that sound unnatural:

**Examples Fixed:**
1. ✓ `environment.json` - "Governments can implement regulations..." → "Many countries have implemented strict regulations..."
2. ✓ `environment.json` - "Governments must invest in green infrastructure..." → "Building green infrastructure such as solar farms..."

**Still Need Review:**
- Many files use repetitive "can [verb]" and "must [verb]" patterns
- Examples like "X can Y to Z" appear frequently across files
- These patterns are technically correct but don't model varied, natural language

**Recommendation**: Review and vary sentence structures in vocabulary examples to show students multiple ways to express ideas naturally.

### 3. **EXERCISE QUANTITY CONCERNS**

#### Too Many Exercises in Step 3
**Finding**: Most topic files contain 45-48 exercises in the "Sentence Builder" step, which may overwhelm students.

**Files Affected**: 48 out of 70 files
- Standard number: 45 exercises
- Some files: 48 exercises (global-tourism, high-rise-living, technology-education)

**Student Impact**:
- Students may feel overwhelmed or fatigued
- Reduces likelihood of completing all exercises
- Could decrease engagement and retention

**Recommendation**: Consider reducing to 20-30 high-quality exercises per topic, focusing on the most useful sentence patterns.

### 4. **WORD COUNT DISCREPANCIES**

**Finding**: Several model essays have mismatches between claimed and actual word counts (though most are minor).

| Topic | Claimed | Actual | Difference |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| adult-illiteracy | 279 | ~289 | +10 |
| celebrities-fame-achievement | 286 | ~292 | +6 |
| children-free-time | 278 | ~268 | -10 |
| delayed-parenthood | 278 | ~271 | -7 |
| extraterrestrial-life | 352 | ~359 | +7 |
| government-funding-education | 286 | ~293 | +7 |
| living-alone-extended-family | 283 | ~293 | +10 |
| museums-local-visitors | 277 | ~285 | +8 |
| smartphone-children | 275 | ~281 | +6 |
| university-subjects | 297 | ~303 | +6 |
| working-hours-success | 274 | ~268 | -6 |

**Recommendation**: Update claimed word counts to match actual counts for accuracy.

### 5. **CONTENT ACCURACY - NEEDS VERIFICATION**

Several files contain specific claims that should be fact-checked:

#### Statistics & Studies
1. **Remote Work File**:
   - "A study by Stanford University found that remote employees reported 13% higher productivity"
   - **Status**: Likely refers to Nicholas Bloom's 2013 study - VERIFY if still current/cited correctly

2. **AI/Automation File**:
   - "up to forty percent of current jobs could be automated within two decades"
   - **Status**: Common claim from various studies - should cite specific source

3. **Environment File (Model Essay)**:
   - "Denmark's investment in wind energy over two decades has transformed it into a global leader in renewable power, generating over forty percent of its electricity from wind"
   - **Status**: Denmark does generate significant wind power - VERIFY current percentage (as of 2025 may have changed)

4. **Celebrity Influence File**:
   - Various claims about increased body dissatisfaction, anxiety rates
   - **Status**: Should cite specific studies if claiming research evidence

**Recommendation**: Add citation sources or soften language (e.g., "Studies suggest..." instead of specific percentages without sources).

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1 (High Impact, Quick Fixes)
1. ✓ **Fix grammar/accuracy errors** - COMPLETED
2. **Update word counts** - Should update JSON files with accurate counts
3. **Verify factual claims** - Fact-check statistics and examples

### Priority 2 (Medium Impact)
4. **Improve sentence naturalness** - Continue reviewing and updating formulaic examples
5. **Add variety to patterns** - Ensure examples show diverse sentence structures
6. **Consider exercise quantity** - Evaluate if 45+ exercises per topic is optimal

### Priority 3 (Lower Priority)
7. **Add more context** - Some examples could benefit from more relatable contexts
8. **Include contemporary examples** - Update examples to reflect 2024-2025 context where relevant
9. **Consider cultural diversity** - Ensure examples represent diverse global perspectives

## DETAILED IMPROVEMENTS MADE

### Files Modified:
1. ✓ `celebrity-role-models.json` - Fixed pronoun error
2. ✓ `environment.json` - Improved 2 vocabulary examples for naturalness
3. ✓ `remote-work.json` - Fixed vocabulary example to include target word

### Specific Changes:
- "Governments can implement regulations to reduce industrial pollution" → "Many countries have implemented strict regulations that significantly reduced industrial pollution"
- "Governments must invest in green infrastructure like renewable energy systems" → "Building green infrastructure such as solar farms and efficient public transport requires substantial investment"
- Added "facilitate" to its own example sentence

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Recommended Actions:
1. Review and approve changes made
2. Decide on exercise quantity (keep 45 or reduce to ~25)
3. Verify factual claims in model essays (Denmark, Stanford study, etc.)
4. Consider systematic review of all vocabulary examples for naturalness
5. Update word counts in affected files

### Files Needing Further Review:
- All files with 45+ exercises (if reducing exercise count)
- All files with word count mismatches (11 files)
- Files with statistical claims (3-4 files)

---

## CONCLUSION

The IELTS Writing Task 2 content is overall of **high quality** with good pedagogical structure. The issues found are primarily:
- Minor language naturalness improvements needed
- Some factual verification required
- Potential exercise quantity optimization

The fixes made address the most critical issues (grammar errors). The remaining recommendations are for enhancing student experience and ensuring complete accuracy.
