    "text": "University curriculum choices remain contentious, with competing priorities between following personal interests and ensuring practical employability. While some advocate that students should pursue subjects they genuinely love regardless of career prospects, others support career-focused education that prioritizes marketable skills. In my opinion, the ideal approach combines personal interest with realistic consideration of job market demands to achieve sustainable long-term success.\n\nAdvocates of passion-based learning argue that following genuine interests produces superior academic outcomes and drives innovation. When students study subjects they love, they demonstrate higher motivation, deeper intellectual engagement, and greater persistence through academic challenges. For instance, many groundbreaking scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs succeeded precisely because they pursued their passions despite uncertain initial career prospects, ultimately making extraordinary contributions to their fields. Furthermore, passion-driven study fosters the creativity and original thinking that society needs for solving complex problems. Therefore, encouraging students to follow their interests can lead to both exceptional personal fulfillment and significant societal benefits through innovation and creative breakthroughs.\n\nConversely, supporters of career-focused education contend that practical subjects offer superior employability and financial security in competitive markets. Degrees in fields like engineering, computer science, nursing, or business administration provide marketable credentials and specialized skills that employers actively seek. For example, technology and healthcare graduates typically secure well-paid positions immediately after graduation, while liberal arts graduates often face prolonged job searches or underemployment in unrelated fields. Moreover, in economically uncertain times, practical qualifications provide crucial financial stability and independence. Thus, pragmatic subject choices help graduates avoid unemployment and achieve economic security more reliably.\n\nIn conclusion, while both following personal passion and prioritizing career prospects offer distinct advantages, I believe students should ideally choose subjects at the intersection of genuine interest and market demand. This balanced approach maximizes both intrinsic motivation and realistic career prospects, leading to sustainable professional success and personal satisfaction.",
