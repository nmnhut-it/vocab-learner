I strongly disagree with this perspective because privacy is a fundamental human right that should not be forfeited based on one's profession.",
              "body1": "The primary reason celebrities deserve privacy protection is that unrestricted media intrusion causes severe psychological harm. This is because constant surveillance and harassment create anxiety, depression, and family stress. For instance, Princess Diana's tragic death in 1997 resulted directly from aggressive paparazzi pursuit, demonstrating how media intrusion can have fatal consequences. As a result, many celebrities report significant mental health challenges and relationship difficulties.",

Choosing a public career does not eliminate one's right to personal and family privacy.

For instance, actors rely on media coverage to promote films and build their careers. This demonstrates that some level of public scrutiny is inherent to fame.",

    "text": "It is often claimed that celebrities should accept media intrusion into their private lives as an inevitable consequence of fame. I strongly disagree with this perspective because privacy is a fundamental human right that should not be forfeited based on one's profession or public recognition.\n\nThe primary reason celebrities deserve privacy protection is that unrestricted media intrusion causes severe psychological harm. Constant surveillance, harassment by paparazzi, and violation of personal boundaries create anxiety, depression, and chronic stress for famous individuals and their families. For instance, Princess Diana's tragic death in 1997 resulted directly from aggressive paparazzi pursuit while fleeing photographers in Paris, demonstrating how media intrusion can have fatal consequences. Similarly, numerous celebrities have reported that relentless tabloid scrutiny contributed to mental health crises and damaged family relationships. As a result, what society dismisses as harmless curiosity actually inflicts serious human suffering.\n\nFurthermore, accepting media intrusion as inevitable undermines fundamental democratic principles. Choosing a public career does not eliminate one's right to personal and family privacy, which international law recognizes as essential to human dignity. There exists a crucial distinction between legitimate public interest in professional activities and exploitative coverage of private matters. For example, celebrity children who never chose fame frequently face unwanted media attention that severely impacts their psychological development and safety. Tabloid culture in Britain led to phone hacking scandals that resulted in criminal prosecutions, revealing how normalized intrusion crosses ethical and legal boundaries. Therefore, society must distinguish between responsible journalism and privacy violation.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly disagree that celebrities should accept unlimited media intrusion. While public figures naturally face greater scrutiny regarding their professional work, their fundamental privacy rights deserve protection through ethical media guidelines, legal safeguards, and public recognition that fame does not justify exploitation.",
