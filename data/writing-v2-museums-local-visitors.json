    "text": "Museums and historical sites attract predominantly international tourists rather than local residents. This phenomenon occurs due to several factors, including overfamiliarity with local heritage and financial barriers, and targeted strategies involving affordable access and community engagement can effectively address this issue.\n\nThe primary reason for low local attendance is that residents feel overly familiar with their cultural heritage. Unlike tourists who experience novelty and excitement when visiting new destinations, locals have been exposed to these sites throughout their lives, reducing their perceived value and appeal. Additionally, admission fees create significant financial obstacles that discourage regular visits by local families operating on limited budgets. For instance, many Londoners never visit the British Museum despite living nearby, while international visitors eagerly pay entrance fees and consider it a highlight of their trip. Consequently, local residents often prioritize exploring new destinations elsewhere rather than revisiting familiar cultural institutions in their own communities.\n\nTo address this issue, museums and historical sites should implement several practical measures. Firstly, offering free entry days specifically for local residents or providing substantial discounts can remove financial barriers and encourage regular visits. Secondly, developing partnerships with local schools to integrate museum visits into educational curricula fosters early heritage appreciation among young residents. Moreover, rotating temporary exhibitions combat familiarity by providing fresh content that gives locals compelling reasons for repeat visits. For example, many European museums have successfully increased local attendance by implementing free admission for residents on certain weekdays, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted pricing strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, local people avoid museums and historical sites primarily due to overfamiliarity and admission costs, but implementing free entry days, educational partnerships, and rotating exhibitions can successfully reverse this trend and strengthen community engagement with cultural heritage.",
