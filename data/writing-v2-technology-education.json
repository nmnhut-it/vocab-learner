Online platforms enable students to access world-class courses and materials regardless of geographic location or physical disabilities. For instance, learners in remote rural areas can now access lectures from prestigious institutions like MIT and Harvard through platforms such as edX and Coursera.

Consequently, technology democratizes education by removing traditional barriers and providing opportunities once limited to privileged populations.\n\nHowever, widespread adoption of educational technology poses serious equity concerns that cannot be overlooked. The fundamental issue is that many disadvantaged families lack reliable internet connectivity and modern devices necessary for fully participating in technology-driven education. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this digital divide became starkly apparent when students from low-income households fell significantly behind their wealthier peers who possessed adequate technological resources. Additionally, pediatric health studies indicate that children spending excessive time on screens face increased risks of obesity, vision problems, and sleep disorders. These disparities threaten to widen rather than narrow educational inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, while educational technology presents legitimate challenges regarding access and student health, I believe the pedagogical advantages significantly outweigh these disadvantages when institutions prioritize equitable resource distribution and establish balanced implementation policies.",
