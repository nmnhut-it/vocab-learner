    "text": "The role of international cooperation in addressing global challenges has sparked considerable debate. While some believe that the primary benefit lies in environmental protection, others argue that businesses gain the most significant advantages. In my opinion, although both areas benefit substantially, environmental protection represents the more critical priority for humanity's long-term survival.\n\nOn the one hand, international environmental cooperation enables nations to address climate change and protect shared ecosystems effectively. This is because environmental threats like global warming and pollution transcend national borders, requiring coordinated action across countries. For instance, the Paris Agreement successfully united 195 nations in committing to binding targets aimed at limiting global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. Similarly, the Montreal Protocol demonstrated how international cooperation could effectively reverse ozone layer depletion. Without such multilateral treaties, individual countries cannot meaningfully reduce carbon emissions or preserve biodiversity. As a result, environmental cooperation protects the planet for future generations and prevents catastrophic climate disasters that would affect all humanity.\n\nOn the other hand, international business cooperation creates substantial economic opportunities and commercial advantages. The main reason is that trade agreements reduce tariffs and eliminate barriers, enabling businesses to access larger markets and increase profitability significantly. For example, the European Union provides member businesses with tariff-free access to a market of 450 million consumers, while the World Trade Organization facilitates global commerce by establishing common trading rules. Furthermore, economic integration improves supply chain efficiency and enables companies to expand operations internationally. Consequently, these advantages drive economic growth, create employment opportunities, and raise living standards globally.\n\nIn conclusion, while international cooperation delivers significant benefits to both environmental protection and business development, I believe environmental protection represents the more critical priority. This is because economic prosperity becomes meaningless on an uninhabitable planet affected by irreversible climate change.",
