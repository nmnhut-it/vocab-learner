          "fullEssay": "The debate over whether higher education should prioritize personal interest or career utility continues to divide opinion among educators and students. While practical considerations regarding employment are important, I believe students achieve greater overall success when pursuing their genuine intellectual interests.\n\nOn the one hand, studying subjects one is passionate about significantly enhances motivation, engagement, and academic performance. Students who pursue their interests demonstrate greater persistence through challenging coursework and are more likely to excel academically. Research consistently shows that students in self-selected majors achieve higher graduation rates and grade point averages than those pressured into pragmatic fields. Furthermore, interest-driven education cultivates critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities that prove valuable across diverse career paths. These transferable skills often matter more to employers than specific technical knowledge, which quickly becomes outdated in rapidly evolving industries. History is replete with examples of successful individuals who followed unconventional academic paths aligned with their passions.\n\nOn the other hand, career-focused education addresses legitimate concerns about financial security and employment prospects. Practical degrees in fields like engineering, medicine, and computer science typically lead to stable, well-paying careers with strong job markets. For instance, STEM graduates generally secure employment faster and earn substantially higher starting salaries than humanities graduates. Given that university education represents a significant financial investment for families, choosing majors with clear career trajectories appears pragmatic and responsible. This consideration becomes particularly important for students from less privileged backgrounds who cannot afford to pursue unmarketable degrees.\n\nIn conclusion, while career-focused subjects offer tangible financial benefits, interest-driven education produces superior engagement, learning outcomes, and transferable competencies. Universities should therefore encourage students to pursue their passions while simultaneously developing practical skills that enhance employability regardless of their chosen field."
