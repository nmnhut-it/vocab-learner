    "text": "Despite improved access to education in recent decades, many adults today still lack basic reading and writing skills. This essay will examine the significant disadvantages that illiterate adults face in modern society and propose practical measures that governments can implement to address this persistent problem.\n\nAdults who cannot read or write encounter severe barriers in employment opportunities, healthcare access, and financial management. Firstly, most modern jobs require functional literacy to read instructions, complete application forms, and use digital systems. For instance, illiterate adults cannot fill out job applications independently or understand employment contracts, which severely limits their career prospects and earning potential. Additionally, they struggle to comprehend healthcare forms, banking documents, and legal contracts, making them vulnerable to exploitation and preventing them from advocating for their rights. As a result, these individuals often experience social exclusion and remain trapped in low-paying manual labor with little opportunity for advancement.\n\nGovernments can implement several effective measures to help illiterate adults develop essential literacy skills. One crucial solution is providing free adult education programs at accessible locations such as community centers and public libraries. For example, governments could offer flexible evening and weekend classes that accommodate working adults with family responsibilities, removing scheduling barriers that prevent participation. Furthermore, authorities should provide financial incentives, transportation support, and childcare services to address practical obstacles that discourage adults from attending literacy programs. These supportive measures would allow more illiterate individuals to access education and subsequently improve their employment opportunities, health outcomes, and overall quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, adult illiteracy creates substantial disadvantages in employment, healthcare, and financial independence, but comprehensive government-funded education programs with flexible scheduling and practical support services can effectively empower illiterate adults to develop literacy skills and participate fully in society.",
