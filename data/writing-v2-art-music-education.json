    "text": "Educators hold divergent views regarding curriculum priorities in schools. While some advocate making art and music compulsory, others contend that academic subjects like mathematics and science deserve greater emphasis. In my view, schools should balance both creative and analytical disciplines to cultivate well-rounded students.\n\nOn the one hand, mandatory arts education provides crucial developmental benefits beyond academic achievement. Engagement with music and visual arts enables students to develop emotional intelligence, creative thinking, and self-expression capabilities that traditional academics cannot fully address. Specifically, research in neuroscience demonstrates that musical training enhances spatial reasoning, pattern recognition, and memory functions. Furthermore, students participating in regular arts programs exhibit improved empathy, self-confidence, and communication abilities. Consequently, comprehensive arts instruction contributes to holistic child development essential for personal fulfillment.\n\nOn the other hand, prioritizing core academic subjects offers tangible advantages for career success in competitive economies. Mathematical and scientific proficiency provides foundational skills that lead to greater access to high-paying technical careers. For example, most positions in engineering, medicine, and technology sectors require strong STEM backgrounds, and data shows graduates with these qualifications earn significantly higher salaries than those with arts-focused education. Moreover, countries such as Singapore and South Korea consistently rank highest in global competitiveness by emphasizing mathematics and science. Therefore, academic emphasis strengthens students' economic opportunities and national productivity.\n\nIn conclusion, while arts education develops creativity and emotional capabilities, and academic subjects provide practical career competencies, I believe educational institutions should integrate both disciplines. Ultimately, balanced curricula prepare students for comprehensive personal and professional success in modern society.",
