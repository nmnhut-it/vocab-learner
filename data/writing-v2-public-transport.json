In my opinion, urban areas should prioritize public transport while rural regions need road development.",

This is because mass transit systems can move thousands of people efficiently while significantly reducing per-capita carbon emissions. For instance, cities like Singapore and Tokyo have world-class subway systems that handle millions of daily commuters, dramatically reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. Therefore, public transport investment yields substantial environmental and efficiency benefits in densely populated areas.",

The reason is that roads facilitate freight transportation, business connectivity, and access to remote communities where public transport is impractical. For example, Australia's extensive highway system enables commerce across vast distances and connects isolated rural communities to essential services. Consequently, road infrastructure remains indispensable for national economic competitiveness and regional equity.",
