              "body1": "The primary reason people prefer foreign films is the exceptional cinematic quality and production values that international studios can afford. Hollywood productions, for instance, invest hundreds of millions of dollars in single films, creating spectacular visual effects and hiring globally recognized actors. Additionally, foreign films benefit from extensive marketing campaigns that create anticipation worldwide. As a result, local productions often appear less impressive by comparison, struggling to attract audiences despite potentially compelling stories.",
              "body2": "In my opinion, governments should provide subsidies to domestic film industries. Firstly, local cinema plays a vital role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage that would otherwise be overshadowed by commercial globalization. Secondly, successful models like French cinema subsidies demonstrate that government support enables local industries to thrive while maintaining cultural authenticity. Although critics argue this represents inefficient use of public funds, cultural diversity and national identity cannot be measured purely in economic terms and warrant protection.",

    "text": "Many people prefer watching foreign films rather than locally produced ones. This preference stems primarily from the superior cinematic quality and extensive marketing reach of international studios, and I believe governments should provide financial support to local film industries to preserve cultural heritage.\n\nThe primary reason for this preference is the exceptional production values that major foreign studios can afford. International producers, particularly Hollywood, regularly invest hundreds of millions of dollars in single films, enabling spectacular visual effects, cutting-edge technology, and globally recognized actors that local industries cannot match. Additionally, foreign films benefit from massive marketing campaigns that create worldwide anticipation and awareness before release. For instance, international blockbusters like Marvel franchises or Avatar attract enormous global audiences and generate box office revenues that locally produced films rarely achieve. Consequently, domestic productions often appear less impressive by comparison and struggle to compete for audience attention, despite potentially offering compelling cultural narratives.\n\nIn my opinion, governments should provide subsidies and tax incentives to support domestic film industries. Firstly, local cinema plays a vital role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage that would otherwise be overshadowed by commercial globalization. Secondly, successful models like French cinema subsidies and South Korean government support demonstrate that public funding enables local industries to thrive while maintaining cultural authenticity and even achieving international recognition. Although critics argue that government funding represents an inefficient use of taxpayer resources, cultural diversity and national identity cannot be measured purely in economic terms and warrant protection from complete commercialization.\n\nIn conclusion, foreign films dominate audience preferences due to massive production budgets and global marketing advantages that local industries cannot match, and governments should provide financial support to domestic cinema because preserving cultural heritage and diversity is essential for maintaining national identity in an increasingly globalized entertainment landscape.",
