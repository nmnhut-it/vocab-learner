    "text": "The substantial salary gap between corporate directors and ordinary employees has become a contentious issue in modern economies. While some people argue that high executive compensation is justified and necessary, others believe it represents unfair income inequality. In my opinion, although executives deserve higher pay than average workers, the current wage gap has become excessive and requires reasonable regulation.\n\nOn the one hand, high executive salaries can be justified by the immense responsibility and specialized skills required for these positions. Corporate directors make strategic decisions that directly impact thousands of employees and billions of dollars in company revenue. For instance, a CEO's choice to expand into new markets, restructure operations, or invest in technology can determine whether an organization thrives or fails over the long term. Furthermore, the talent pool for effective executives is relatively small, and companies must offer competitive compensation packages including performance bonuses and stock options to attract and retain qualified leaders. As a result, market forces naturally drive executive compensation to levels that reflect their scarcity and value to shareholders.\n\nOn the other hand, excessive executive pay creates unjust income inequality that damages both employee morale and social cohesion. Many corporations now have CEO-to-worker pay ratios exceeding 300 to 1, meaning executives earn in one day what ordinary employees earn in an entire year. For example, while top executives receive multi-million dollar compensation packages, many frontline workers struggle to afford basic necessities despite working full-time. This disparity undermines the principle of corporate responsibility and suggests that ordinary employees are undervalued despite their essential contributions to company success. Moreover, extreme wage gaps can reduce productivity as workers become demotivated and resentful.\n\nIn conclusion, while executive roles merit higher compensation due to their responsibilities and impact, I believe current pay disparities have become socially harmful. Implementing reasonable limits on executive-to-worker pay ratios would help balance competitive compensation with social justice and fairness.",
