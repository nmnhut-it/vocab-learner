    "text": "In today's digital age, many people argue that the widespread use of mobile phones and computers is diminishing people's ability to communicate face-to-face. While I partially agree that excessive reliance on digital communication can weaken interpersonal skills, I believe technology also offers valuable opportunities to enhance and maintain meaningful connections.\n\nOn one hand, excessive dependence on texting and instant messaging can indeed harm face-to-face communication abilities. This is primarily because digital communication removes the need to practice reading non-verbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. For instance, many teenagers who primarily interact through social media platforms often struggle to maintain eye contact, interpret social signals, or initiate conversations during in-person meetings. Research indicates that young adults spend an average of five hours daily on digital communication, significantly reducing time available for face-to-face socializing. As a result, these individuals may develop social anxiety and find real-world interactions increasingly uncomfortable and challenging.\n\nHowever, technology also provides valuable tools that facilitate communication in ways previously impossible. Video calling platforms like Zoom and FaceTime enable people to see facial expressions and observe body language even when separated by vast distances. For example, international families can maintain close emotional connections through regular video chats, which preserve many visual elements of communication that pure text-based messaging lacks. Furthermore, digital communication offers accessibility benefits for people with social anxiety, hearing impairments, or speech difficulties, allowing them to communicate more comfortably and confidently.\n\nIn conclusion, while excessive digital communication can diminish opportunities to practice essential interpersonal skills, I believe the key issue is not technology itself but rather how people choose to use it. Maintaining strong face-to-face communication abilities requires conscious effort to balance digital convenience with regular in-person interaction.",
