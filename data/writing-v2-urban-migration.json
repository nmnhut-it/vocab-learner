However, I largely disagree with this approach, as alternative strategies such as improving public infrastructure and promoting remote working are more effective and sustainable.\n\nAdmittedly, concentrating populations in cities could reduce long-distance commuter traffic significantly. When people live closer to their workplaces, the need for daily suburban-to-city commutes that cause rush hour congestion is eliminated. For instance, research indicates that suburban commuters account for over sixty percent of peak-hour traffic in major metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, this benefit would be offset by severe urban overcrowding, housing shortages, and infrastructure strain that mass migration would inevitably create.\n\nMoreover, investing in sustainable transport infrastructure and flexible work policies represents a more practical solution. Enhanced public transport systems can efficiently move large populations without requiring residential displacement. For example, Tokyo successfully manages millions of daily commuters through its extensive subway and high-speed rail networks, allowing people to live in surrounding areas while maintaining manageable city traffic levels. Similarly, the rise of remote working trends since the pandemic has demonstrated that reducing unnecessary commutes can significantly alleviate traffic congestion without forcing population relocation. Additionally, cities like Copenhagen have created car-free city centers and expanded cycling infrastructure, proving that traffic problems can be solved through urban planning rather than demographic engineering.\n\nIn conclusion, while urban migration might reduce some commuter traffic, I believe comprehensive public transport investment, car-free zones, and remote working policies are far more practical approaches.
