I strongly disagree with this view, as staying informed through news is essential for both personal decision-making and democratic participation.\n\nFirstly, news provides crucial information that directly impacts people's daily lives and financial well-being. Government policies, economic developments, and health advisories reported through news outlets affect household budgets, employment prospects, and family planning decisions. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people relied heavily on news updates to understand lockdown measures, health guidelines, and financial support programs. Similarly, news about tax policy changes or interest rate adjustments enables citizens to make informed decisions about major purchases, investments, and savings strategies. Without access to this information, individuals would struggle to navigate the complex systems that govern their lives.\n\nMoreover, news consumption empowers civic engagement and strengthens democratic processes. An informed citizenry is fundamental to healthy democracy, as voters need knowledge of current affairs to evaluate candidates and hold elected officials accountable. For example, understanding politicians' voting records, policy positions, and responses to community concerns requires following news coverage throughout election cycles. Furthermore, awareness of social issues through news reporting enables citizens to participate meaningfully in public discourse and advocate for positive change in their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly maintain that news has profound relevance to people's lives rather than being a waste of time.
