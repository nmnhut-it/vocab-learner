    "text": "The question of how fresh water should be managed has become increasingly urgent as water scarcity affects many regions worldwide. While some believe that individuals have the right to use as much water as they want, others argue that governments must tightly control water consumption. In my opinion, strict government regulation is essential because fresh water is a finite resource vital for human survival and environmental sustainability.\n\nOn the one hand, advocates of unlimited water use believe that individuals should have the freedom to consume water without government interference. This perspective is based on individual rights principles and the belief that property ownership includes the right to use resources on one's land. For instance, homeowners argue they should be able to water lawns, fill swimming pools, and maintain gardens freely, especially if they pay for the water consumed. Furthermore, some contend that market forces through pricing can naturally regulate consumption without requiring government restrictions. As a result, they view mandatory water rationing and usage limits as unwarranted interference in personal freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, supporters of government control argue that strict water regulation is necessary to protect this limited natural resource. The main reason is that unrestricted consumption leads to rapid groundwater depletion and threatens long-term water security. For example, California implemented mandatory water restrictions during severe droughts between 2012 and 2017, which successfully reduced urban water consumption by 25% and prevented reservoir depletion. Moreover, agricultural water use, which accounts for 70% of global fresh water consumption, requires careful regulation to prevent wasteful irrigation practices. Therefore, government oversight through water metering, usage limits, and conservation incentives ensures sustainable usage for current and future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, while individual freedom is valued in democratic societies, I believe that government control of fresh water usage is essential given the reality of water scarcity. Without strict regulation and conservation measures, this vital resource will be depleted, threatening human survival and ecosystem health.",
