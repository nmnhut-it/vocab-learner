    "text": "There is ongoing debate about whether international tourism benefits or harms destination countries. While tourist revenue undoubtedly provides economic advantages, I believe that uncontrolled tourism causes environmental degradation and cultural erosion that outweigh these benefits unless sustainable practices are implemented.\n\nOn the one hand, tourism generates substantial income for host nations. Foreign visitors contribute billions of dollars through spending on accommodation, dining, transportation, and attractions, which creates employment across multiple sectors. For instance, countries like Thailand and the Maldives derive approximately 20% of their GDP from tourism-related activities. Moreover, tourism revenue enables governments to fund infrastructure improvements and conservation projects that benefit both visitors and local residents. This economic injection can lift entire communities out of poverty.\n\nOn the other hand, mass tourism inflicts considerable damage on natural environments and local cultures. When visitor numbers exceed the carrying capacity of destinations, pollution intensifies, habitats deteriorate, and traditional ways of life become commercialized. For example, popular sites such as Venice and Barcelona now face severe overtourism, resulting in infrastructure strain, resident displacement, and loss of authentic cultural character. Furthermore, fragile ecosystems like coral reefs in Southeast Asia have suffered irreversible damage from excessive diving and boat traffic. These impacts threaten the very attractions that originally drew tourists.\n\nIn conclusion, while international tourism offers economic benefits through revenue generation and employment creation, I believe its environmental and cultural costs are too significant to ignore. Destination governments must therefore implement strict visitor limits and sustainable tourism policies to protect natural and cultural resources for future generations.",
