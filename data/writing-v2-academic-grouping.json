    "text": "The debate over how schools should organize students for instruction has intensified in recent years. While some educators believe that grouping students according to their academic abilities produces better outcomes, others contend that mixed-ability classrooms create more equitable learning environments. In my opinion, the most effective approach depends on the subject being taught and the resources available to support differentiation.\n\nOn the one hand, ability grouping allows teachers to provide instruction tailored to students' learning pace and current performance level. When students with similar capabilities study together, educators can adjust lesson difficulty and progression speed without leaving anyone behind or holding advanced learners back. For instance, the grammar school system in the United Kingdom demonstrates how selecting academically talented students enables them to study advanced curricula, often leading to exceptional examination results. Furthermore, streaming can benefit struggling students by providing targeted support in smaller groups where they feel less intimidated. As a result, both high and low achievers can progress more effectively than in heterogeneous settings.\n\nOn the other hand, mixed-ability teaching promotes educational equity and valuable peer learning experiences. The main reason is that diverse classroom composition allows stronger students to help weaker ones while simultaneously reinforcing their own understanding through teaching. Research from Finland's inclusive education system suggests that collaborative learning in heterogeneous classes benefits students across all performance levels, not just those struggling. Moreover, mixed-ability classrooms reduce the stigmatization that often accompanies streaming into lower groups, protecting students' self-esteem and motivation. Therefore, this approach creates socially integrated learning communities that better prepare young people for diverse workplaces.\n\nIn conclusion, while both streaming and mixed-ability teaching offer distinct advantages in terms of academic progress and social development, I believe schools should implement flexible grouping strategies rather than rigid systems. The optimal approach varies depending on subject requirements, with subjects like mathematics potentially benefiting from ability grouping while project-based subjects thrive in diverse settings.",
